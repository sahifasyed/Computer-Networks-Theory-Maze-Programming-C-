# Computer Networks â€“ Theory & Maze Programming (C)

This repository documents my work and achievements in the **Computer and Network Systems** module, completed during the **first year** of my BSc (Hons) Cyber Security and Digital Forensics degree at UWE Bristol.

ðŸ“Š **Overall Module Score**: 79/100 (Distinction)  
ðŸ§  The module combined theoretical networking concepts with a low-level programming challenge â€” solving a maze using C in a custom emulator environment.

## ðŸ§ª Assessment Breakdown

### 1. ðŸ“˜ Networking Theory Tests
I completed two individual theory assessments focused on core networking topics, including:

- IP addressing and subnetting  
- OSI and TCP/IP models  
- Packet structure and transmission  
- Routing protocols and NAT  
- Protocol analysis and data encapsulation  

**Results:**
- **Test 1:** 94/100  
- **Test 2:** 88/100  

These assessments required both detailed technical explanation and accurate applied calculations using binary and hexadecimal systems.

### 2. ðŸ’» Practical Programming Task â€“ *The Maze Solver*

In the practical portion of the module, I was challenged to write a **C program** that navigates and solves a virtual maze using a custom instruction-based emulator provided by the university.

**Objectives:**
- Read the maze structure from memory
- Navigate from the start to the goal avoiding dead ends
- Use loops, conditionals, and memory operations effectively

**Tools Used:**
- C Programming Language
- UWE Custom Emulator (for testing, simulation, and execution)

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Low-level problem-solving and control flow
- Debugging in a constrained, simulated hardware environment
- Writing efficient, modular C code for a systems-level task
